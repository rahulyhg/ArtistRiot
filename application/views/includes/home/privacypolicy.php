                   <p> Contact information from the registration forms is used to create a unique record to identify the user to the system and for sending information to the member, but is not used for any other purpose. We never sell or rent the information of our users. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This is used for your profiles and is provided to persons who want to contact you through our website for organizing events.</p>

It is important to remember that we cannot always determine that a member is a child under the age of 18. Members under the age of 18 must have written parental consent to release their name or other personal information.</p>
